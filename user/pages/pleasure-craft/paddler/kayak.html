    <h3>Rules of the Road</h3>
    <p>As lesser manoeuvrable craft than powerboats, PWCs or Sailboats, Kayaks are most often considered the Stand-On vessels.  Therefore, when encountering boats of greater manoeuvrability, maintain your course and speed to enable the give-way boat to take appropriate action.</p>
    <p>Due to the susceptibility of kayaks to wakes from larger vessels, it is advisable to stay well clear of these larger craft, where possible.  Further, should you have to cross primary shipping channels, action should be taken to cross at right angles to expedite the crossing and minimize the danger.</p>
</div>
<div class="nav-aids">
    <h3>Aids to Navigation</h3>
    <p>Aids to Navigation do not always apply to kayakers due to their vessels shallow draft, small size and ability to hug the shorelines. However, it is important for kayakers to have an understanding of the different types of Aids to Navigation so they are aware of how other powered vessels and vessels under sail will be manoeuvring around buoys and restriction signs.</p>
    <p>Aids to Navigation are any type of maker that assists boaters in their safe navigation of waterways. These aids to navigation can be broken down into two types: Buoys, which are makers on the water and Day Beacons, which are markers on land. They can each come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours. Furthermore, some may be illuminated to make them easier to see when visibility is limited. Navigation charts will indicate if a specific aid is illuminated along with the light’s colour and flashing pattern. Restriction signs are other types of navigational aids that inform each boater of certain laws and restrictions that pertain to various waterways.</p>

    <h3>Signalling for Help</h3>
    <p>When it comes to signalling your need for assistance, a key factor that comes into play is how far away you are from those whom you will need to communicate with.  Some pieces of signalling equipment are designed for short distance signalling (where help is within visual/audible range), others for medium distance signalling (where help is just outside the visual range) while still others for long distance signalling (where help is outside reasonable visual range.)   You should, therefore, ensure that you have the signalling capabilities best suited to the maximum distance you may encounter within your boating environment.</p>
    <p>Because of the compact nature of kayaks, it’s not easy to carry a lot of signalling equipment. At a minimum, the Small Vessel Regulations mandate that the following be carried on board.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Either a watertight flashlight OR 6 flares of types A, B or C must be carried on board if the overall length of the craft is greater than 6 meters.  If possible to carry both, the more equipment, the better.</li>
        <li>A sound signalling device or appliance.</li>
    </ul>
