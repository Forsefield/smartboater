## File a Float Plan

Tell a person you know and trust where you are going and when you expect to return. Include your expected route and if it is a long trip call in every day, especially if you change your travel plans. If you are late or do not call in when expected, make sure that they understand what to do. They should call the Canadian Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Centre.

##### Close your Float Plan

When you do return, let them know. If you donâ€™t, an unnecessary search may be launched wasting valuable Search and Rescue services.
