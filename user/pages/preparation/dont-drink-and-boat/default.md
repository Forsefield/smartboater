## Don't Drink and Boat

Drinking and boating is illegal and very dangerous. Even under normal conditions the motion of the boat combined with sun and wind can dull your senses. Add alcohol and/or medication and things can get even worse clouding your judgment and slowing hand/eye coordination.

Boat responsibly. Drinking and driving, while on land or water is against the law and consequences can be severe and long lasting. You as the boat operator are responsible for your safety and that of your passengers. Always be alert and donâ€™t put other boaters in danger.

Rules on drinking and boating and legal alcohol limits are different in each Province and Territory so contact your local police department for more specific information.
