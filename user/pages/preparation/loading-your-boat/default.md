## Loading Your Boat

Donâ€™t over load your boat with equipment and/or people. An overloaded boat will be unstable, more likely to roll and take on water. Follow the maximum recommended safe limits for weight which includes both people and gear. Secure all loose gear, keep the load low in the boat and well distributed. Avoid quick movements in canoes.
