## Spark Ignition Protection

Every boat that has an engine or propane powered device(s) must have electrical parts that are spark or ignition protected. These parts, that are clearly labelled as ignition protected, are specifically designed so that, under normal conditions, they will not ignite and fuel related fumes or vapour. Use only parts or replacement parts that are clearly labelled as ignition protected.

Many boats, new or old, have been fitted with converted automotive engines so if you are not sure that your engine(s) is ignition protected, talk to you local certified marine mechanic and be sure that you, your passengers and your boat are not at risk.
