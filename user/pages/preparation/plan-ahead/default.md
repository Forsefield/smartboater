## Plan Ahead

Know where you are at all times and be aware of local hazards and current water levels.

The Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) produces all official Canadian charts and publications. They also offer digital charts that have all the detail found on paper charts. Charts and publications can be purchased from authorized dealers.  For a complete list, go to [www.charts.gc.ca](www.charts.gc.ca).

##### Understand Local Conditions

Before heading out, know how to plot a course, use a compass and charts and use electronic navigation equipment. Understand tide tables, aids to navigation, lights and signals and notices to mariners (chart updates).

Be aware of local water levels, the direction of water flow and the times of low, slack or high tides.
