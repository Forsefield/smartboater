## Personal Locator Beacon (PLB)

<span style="color: #CC0000;">Long Distance</span>

PLB’s operate on the same principle as EPIRB’s, but are more portable and can be taken ashore when leaving the immediate vicinity of the canoe. They are great pieces of compact equipment used to signal that you are in distress and need assistance. They are especially useful if you are unable to readily communicate your location to the Search & Rescue personnel who will be tasked to your aid. Once activated, the PLB’s signal both alerts and provides your position through a network of satellites that are relayed to the Joint Rescue Co-ordination Center.  PLB’s operate at a frequency of 406 MHz.
