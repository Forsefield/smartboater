## Manual Propelling Device

A manual propelling device can be a set of oars or a paddle or anything that a person can operate by hand or foot to propel a boat, including the rudder on a small open sail boat or a paddle wheel on a paddleboat. But, keep in mind the purpose of the manual propelling device and chose something appropriate for your vessel.  It is there to help you manoeuvre your vessel in close quarters if the engine has quit and / or, depending on the size of your vessel, to help you make it to shore.  If you opt for a set of oars, make sure that your boat has oar locks or you would be just as well off with a paddle.
