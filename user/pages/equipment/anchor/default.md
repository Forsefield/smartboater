## Anchor

A good anchor with the proper chain/rope arrangement is handy for everyday boating and “cheap insurance” in the event that you need to stay in one position to wait for help to arrive. This is especially true if you have a dead engine and a strong wind pushing you ashore or equally as bad, offshore.

Anchors have to be properly sized for your boat and manufacturers provide recommendations as to the best size of anchor to your vessel. Just as important is having the right style of anchor. There are different types of anchors for different types of bottoms, whether it is mud, rock, weeds, etc. The key is to have the right style and weight of anchor and proper line (rode) for your particular boat. If you don’t, rough winds and water can cause the boat to drag, leaving it to drift. This is especially important if you are asleep or away from the boat, even swimming nearby, which can leave you stranded in the water.

The ideal anchor rode is a chain and rope combination. For an anchoring system, more chain is better. The rule of thumb is 1 meter of chain (2cm galvanized) for every meter of boat length. A chain will help ‘lay the anchor rode along the bottom’ helping the anchor to dig in and stay dug in. Make sure that the chain is firmly attached to the anchor and the rope firmly attached to the chain. If using shackles as your fastening mechanism, use a tie to ensure the shackles do not come undone.

If you plan to do a lot of anchoring out, having a main anchor and another one as back-up is a good idea. And make your back up anchor another type. That way you will have more options to have good holding in a variety of bottom conditions. Your secondary anchor should also be easily accessible and not buried in the bottom of a locker.

For storage of your main anchor, a proper bow roller arrangement and a well sized chain/rope locker are big pluses. Ideally, the chain locker should be totally independent from the interior of the boat and fitted with a drain above the waterline to evacuate water that gets into it.

When it comes to the length of anchor rode (rope and chain combined), the established rule of thumb is to use a ratio of at least 5 to 1 (5 times the depth of the water you are anchoring in), plus a length equivalent to the height of the freeboard of the boat and up to 7 to 1 if the weather is bad and waves and winds are an issue. This means that in 10 feet of water and if your freeboard is 3 feet you will let out at least 65 feet of chain/rope and a total of 91 feet if the wind picks up or if the bottom is bad.

Before you anchor, make sure that everything is secure; the chain is firmly attached to the anchor, the rope firmly attached to the chain and the free end of the anchor rope firmly attached to your vessel.
