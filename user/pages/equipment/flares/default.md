## Flares

Visual distress signals, such as flares, are a great way to attract attention and let others know you are in need of help.  Here are some key points:

* Flares are only required by law on manually powered boats, such as kayaks and canoes, if you are paddling on one of the great lakes or an ocean and/or bodies of water where you find yourself more than 1 nautical mile (approximately 1.9km) from shore. Where flares are not mandated, a watertight flashlight must be available for signalling purposes.
* Flares are not required for a boat that has no sleeping quarters and is engaged in an official competition or in final preparation for an official competition.
* Flares should be carried if you are travelling away from shorelines into remote areas, isolated from other vessels/populated regions where long distance signalling is needed to attract attention across a wide area.
* When buying visual distress flares, look for a Transport Canada approval stamp or label. Always check the expiry date of your flares. Remember that flares are only good for four years from the date of manufacture, which is stamped on every flare. It is important to keep your flares in a watertight container and they should be kept within reach and stored vertically in a cool, dry location to keep them in good working condition.
* When your current flares are date expired, as long as they appear to be in good shape, keep them aboard as back ups to double the amount you have available on board.
