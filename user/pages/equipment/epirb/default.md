## EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon)

<span style="color: #CC0000;">Long Distance</span>

An EPIRB is a floating radio distress beacon that can transmit for hours.  They can be manually activated or float free from a sinking or overturned vessel.  The EPIRB signal both alerts and provides your position to a network of satellites that are relayed to a Joint Rescue Co-ordination Center, from which help will be dispatched.  EPIRBS using 406 MHz will be the only ones recognized and older EPIRBs operating on 121.5/243 MHz should be replaced with 406 MHz beacons as soon as possible.

EPIRB’s must be registered with the Canadian Beacon Registry at http://beacons.nss.gc.ca and contact information should be kept up to date. Although paddle crafts are not required to carry EPIRB’s, they are a good idea especially if you intend to paddle in large bodies of water or in areas where help is not close at hand.
