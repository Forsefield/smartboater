## Lifebuoy

When buying a lifebuoy, look for a Canadian approval stamp or label. Lifebuoys must be at least 610 mm (24”) in diameter. SOLAS lifebuoys are 762 mm (30”) in diameter and red in colour. Smaller lifebuoys and horseshoe-type devices are not approved. The key is to have the lifebuoy ready to be deployed. It should be placed in an easy to access spot on your vessel. Consider carrying your lifebuoy close to the stern of your boat where it can be accessed and thrown to someone in the water easily.

Although the rules require one lifebuoy, if space allows at the stern, why not add another one.
