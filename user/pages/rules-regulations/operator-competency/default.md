## Operator Competency

As of September 15, 2009 everyone who operates a boat powered by any type or size of motor must carry proof of operator competency on board at all times. That proof can take one of three forms:

* Proof that you have successfully completed a boating safety course in Canada prior to April 1, 1999. Proof can be in the form of a copy of the course completion certificate.
* A Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC) which is good for life.
* A completed boat rental safety check list which is required for each rental.

Proof that you hold a Marine Safety Certificate* that appears on a list approved by Transport Canada for the issuance of PCO Cards.

If you have a Marine Safety Certificate that appears on a list approved by Transport Canada for the issuance of PCO Cards then you are not required to have any of the above. Simply carry the original or a copy of the approved marine Safety Certificate. For a complete list of approved Marine Safety Certificates go to [www.boatingsafety.gc.ca](www.boatingsafety.gc.ca).

Take a copy of your PCOC and keep it in a safe place in case you need a replacement.

To get a replacement contact the provider who issued your original card. If you canâ€™t remember who that Provider was, look for a copy of the receipt/temporary certificate that was given to you when you completed the test or ask someone who might have been with you when you challenged the test. For a complete list of Approved Providers go to [www.boatingsafety.gc.ca](www.boatingsafety.gc.ca).
