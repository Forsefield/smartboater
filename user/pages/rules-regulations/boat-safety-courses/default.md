## Recreational Boating Safety Courses

It is always a good idea to take a paddling safety course. Taking a course will not only advance your paddling skills, but will also better prepare you for a fun and safe time on the water. Approved courses include such topics as:

* Getting ready for a trip.
* Required Safety equipment.
* Regulations and rules of the road for boaters.
* Aids to navigation.
* Sharing the waterways and
* Emergency procedures
* For a list of Approved Providers who offer both approved courses and tests go to [www.boatingsafety.gc.ca](http://www.boatingsafety.gc.ca/) or contact Transport Canada.

Paddlers do not require a Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC) because their vessels are human powered. However, it is a good idea to take the test to obtain your PCO Card which will increase your boating safety knowledge. All persons operating a powered recreational vessel must now have their PCO Card.
