## Dye Marker

<span style="color: #CC0000;">Short Distance</span>

Releasing a dye marker over the side will colour the water a contrasting colour (usually orange or green), making it easy for aerial sighting.  This is, however, not an effective way of signalling distress to other boats or those on land.
