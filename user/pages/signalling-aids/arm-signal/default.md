## Arm Signal

<span style="color: #CC0000;">Short Distance</span>

Another effective, commonly used short-distance signalling technique is the use of Arm Signals. Typically, this is accomplished by standing in the cockpit, on the bow or foredeck of the vessel repeatedly raising and lowering outstretched arms. However, in a canoe it is better to stay seated while repeatedly raising and lowering outstretched arms, so that the vessel remains stable in the water and you donâ€™t risk tipping by standing up.
