## Flares

<span style="color: #CC0000;">Medium Distance</span>

Flares are only valid for 4 years from the date of manufacture; a reference which is printed right on the flare itself.   (Be sure to check this date when purchasing flares to ensure you’re not unknowingly buying old stock.) 

It’s vitally important that you read the manufacturer’s instructions on the proper use of the flares when you buy them and at the start of each season to ensure that you are familiar with how to deploy them safely.  Don’t wait until you need them to read these instructions.   Flares should be kept in a waterproof container, stored in a cool, dry place away from any direct heat source, and are readily accessible.  Be sure to have a utensil to open the (often heat sealed) package.
