## Watertight Flashlight

<span style="color: #CC0000;">Short Distance</span>

It’s important to have a waterproof flashlight with fresh batteries aboard as it can be used effectively in low light conditions to signal for assistance. Waterproof means that the flashlight will operate for a minimum of one minute while totally submerged.  Three short bursts followed by three long and then three short signals, “S-O-S”.  This should be repeated at regular intervals.
