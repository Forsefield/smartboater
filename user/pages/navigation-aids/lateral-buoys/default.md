## Lateral Buoys

Lateral buoys and day beacons mark the side on which they may be safely passed.  This determination of safe passage can only be made by first assessing whether one is proceeding in an upstream or downstream direction.  A helpful mnemonic is to consider that, when one is leaving harbour or land progressing out to sea, they are going downstream.  Conversely, when one is progressing from seaward towards land or harbour, they are proceeding in an upstream direction.

	<h4>Port-Hand Lateral Buoys</h4>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-image"><img src="/images/port-hand-lateral-buoy.png"></div>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-desc">
		<p>Port-hand lateral buoys are green, with a flat top and should be kept on one’s Port (Left) side when proceeding in an upstream direction.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="nav-aid-details">
	<h4>Starboard-Hand Lateral Buoys</h4>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-image"><img src="/images/starboard-hand-lateral-buoy.png"></div>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-desc">
		<p>Starboard-hand lateral buoys are red with a pointed top and should be kept on one’s Starboard (Right) side when proceeding in an upstream direction.</p>
		<p>Another helpful mnemonic is to remember the three R’s.  “Red, Right, Returning”.  This will remind you to keep the Red (Starboard) hand buoys on your right side when you’re returning (going in an upstream direction).</p>
		<p>Other extremely useful characteristics of these buoys are the Port hand buoy’s flat top vs. the Starboard hand buoy’s conical or pointed top.  These allow their type to be more easily discerned during periods of low visibility when it may be only possible to make out their silhouette.   Also, should you become lost while on the water, it’s helpful to know that Port hand buoys carry a sequential odd number while Starboard hand buoys carry a sequential even number.    These correspond to numbers on marine charts that can be referenced to determine one’s position on the water relative to where you want to go.</p>

	<h4>Bifurcation Buoys</h4>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-image"><img src="/images/bifurcation-buoy.png"><br><img src="/images/bifurcation-buoy2.png"></div>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-desc">
		<p>Where one encounters a junction which can be safely followed either to port or to starboard, you may find this marked with a Bifurcation Buoy which is both red and green in colour.  The preferred (safest) route can be determined by the top-most colour.</p>
		<p>If the top-most colour is green, it should be treated like a port-hand buoy and kept on one’s port side while proceeding in an upstream direction.</p> 
		<p>If the top-most colour is red, it should be treated as a starboard-hand buoy and kept on one’s starboard side while proceeding in an upstream direction.</p>

	<h4>Fairway Buoys</h4>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-image"><img src="/images/fairway-buoy.png"></div>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-desc">
		<p>When one is about to enter a channel, they may encounter a buoy with red and white vertical stripes.  These are called Fairway Buoys.  They can be safely passed on both sides but, when marking the centre of the channel, should be kept on one’s port side. (i.e. Treat them like the white lines that divide lanes of a highway.)</p>

	<h4>Isolated Danger Buoys</h4>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-image"><img src="/images/isolated-danger-buoy.png"></div>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-desc">
		<p>Another buoy that warrants careful attention is an Isolated Danger Buoy which is configured with black-red-black horizontal markings.  It is moored directly on or over top of wrecks or small shoals.  The danger is of limited extent and has navigable water all around it.  Navigation charts can be consulted to determine more information about the size, depth and nature of the danger.</p>

	<h4>Lateral Day Beacons</h4>
	<p>As stated previously Day Beacons differ from buoys in that they are on land and may be affixed to a post, tree, rock, bridge support, etc.   Similar to lateral buoys, they mark on which side they may be safely passed and are dependent on whether one is proceeding in an upstream or downstream direction.</p>
	<h6>Port-Hand Day Beacon</h6>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-image"><img src="/images/port-hand-day-beacon.png"></div>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-desc">
		<p>Port-hand day beacons are an open green square surrounding a solid black inner square.  They should be kept to one’s port (left) side when proceeding in an upstream direction.</p>
	</div>
	<h6>Starboard-Hand Day Beacon</h6>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-image"><img src="/images/starboard-hand-day-beacon.png"></div>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-desc">
		<p>Starboard-hand day beacons are a red open triangle surrounding a solid red triangle.  They should be kept to one’s starboard side when proceeding in an upstream direction.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="nav-aid-details">
	<h4>Bifurcation Day Beacons</h4>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-image"><img src="/images/starboard-bifurcation-day-beacon.png"><br><img src="/images/port-bifurcation-day-beacon.png"></div>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-desc">
		<p>Bifurcation day beacons, like bifurcation buoys mark a junction where it is safe to proceed either to port or to starboard.  They are diamond-shaped with a red border.  Within the diamond will be shown either a solid green square or a solid red triangle.  These inner shapes indicate that the preferred route is to starboard or port respectively.</p>

<div class="nav-aid-details">
	<h4>Range Day Beacons</h4>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-image"><img src="/images/range-day-beacon.png"></div>
	<div class="nav-aid-details-desc">
		<p>Range Day Beacons are used to guide vessels through a channel.  They consist of two or more markers situated one above the other a significant distance apart. The lower marker is constructed near ground level at the shore while the upper marker is attached to a tower, located higher than the lower marker.   One navigates through the channel by maintaining a course that keeps one marker aligned top and bottom with the other. When the two markers are lined up vertically, the boater is on the recommended course.</p>
